# Number Type Identifier

This is a simple C++ project that determines the type of a given number (Natural, Whole, Integer, Rational, or Irrational). This project was inspired by a review of the number system, and it serves as a way to test C++ programming skills.

## Description
This program prompts the user to input a number in different formats, such as:
- Integer (e.g., `2`, `-1`)
- Decimal (e.g., `3.14`)
- Fraction (e.g., `2/3`)

Based on the input, the program determines if the number is:
- A Natural number
- A Whole number
- An Integer
- A Rational number
- An Irrational number

## Features
- **Input Handling**: Accepts integers, decimals, and fractions as input.
- **Number Classification**: Uses mathematical functions to identify the type of number.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Displays the classification(s) of the input number.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of C++ and number systems

### Compiling and Running
To compile and run the program:
```bash
g++ number_type_identifier.cpp -o number_type_identifier
./number_type_identifier
